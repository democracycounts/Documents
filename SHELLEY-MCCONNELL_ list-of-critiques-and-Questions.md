FROM SHELLEY MCCONNELL:

1. The Carter Center already invented an electronic system for instant reporting by election observers, and is using it in the field. I would not be surprised if several other such systems are operative, and unless and until you show that yours is better I am left wondering whether you have done your homework.
 

2. The notion of doing a parallel count (or partial parallel count that is not a “quick count” statistical calculation by instead a copy of the results) is not new either and is done all the time. Your material shows no cognizance of that. I am left wondering what your value added is over citizens audits now conducted. The observer groups in Nicaragua, for example, run systems to collect vote tallies and reports of incidents, and have exported those systems to other domestic observer groups. Why is yours different and better? Again, due diligence is missing.



3. Some parallel counts are different from what you propose in that they are based on legal copies of the vote tabulation document collected by political parties, not citizen self-reporting. These are subject to party manipulation (they can just not collect results from places they do not win) and do not hold water legally, but where they are complete and honest they are sometimes audited by citizens groups (Nicaragua 2008) and have had more legitimacy than parallel counts based on citizens groups typing into their cell phones the vote totals posted on the doors of the voting booths, because there is less room for error.



4. You make no effort to show that the reporting you propose to undertake is legal. Some countries, and notable those where the government intends to cheat, ban quick counts and parallel counts. Other countries allow them but require that the results not be reported in national media for 24-48 hours, so the systems lose one major advantage, which is their immediacy. Granted, those operating such systems often leak their results to diplomats and CNN, getting around the restrictions, but they are vulnerable to legal action if they do. You should address whether the tool you are inventing will land people in jail.



5. As far as I can tell from the website, your system does not do what it claims, namely expose fraud. All it does is collect information reported by people with no official status, whose integrity is not necessarily higher than that of the voting officials. If there is a discrepancy in the numbers reported by your system and those reported by the government, who is to say that the fraudulent results are the government results? Anyway, whether people believe the government and not you will depend on their prior politics. Meanwhile, the government will dismiss the results you report, and foreign countries will be unable to acknowledge your results.



6. Your system could easily just report false information. People lie in exit polls all the time. Why do you suppose they will not do so in yours?



7. Your app for working in the polling booths is likely illegal in most countries. Cell phones and cameras are prohibited in polling booths in many countries.



8. Your system could create false expectations about who has won the election, and that could cast doubt on non-fraudulent results. In short, you might undercut democratic behavior by honest officials, particularly in countries where the state is weak or democracy is new.



9. The storage of the totals you collect in a  super-safe manner is nice, but if the information collected is essentially opinion and has no legal standing then you are protecting an opinion poll.



10. Your claim that votes cannot be changed after the fact is false. Even if I accepted that somehow your system would detect such a change, it does not prevent the change. If the election authorities are behind the post-facto vote changes, they will not investigate the discrepancy. That is, either the election officials are honest or they are corrupt. If they are honest there is no need for your system, and if they are corruptr they will simply ignore your information. You might not even be able to make a stink. Local media will not risk their businesses by backing your claims given that you are essentially collecting a poll.


11. Most countries were fraud occurs are weakly democratic and citizens are uncertain of their rights. Even where asking citizens how they intend to vote (Entering Voter app) or how they voted (Exit Voting App) is legal, they may be very frightened by being asked. Word will get around quickly on election day that there are people outside the polling booths asking how you plan to vote or how you voted, and that will deter people from going to the polls as they will assume that those asking are affiliated with one party or another. Authoritarians will have an easier time staying in office legally (without fraud) if vote turnout is low, since those who support the government will not be intimidated by the presence of someone asking how they voted. In short, your system could reduce the chanced of ousting undemocratic governments through the ballot box.



12. The Voter App will swiftly lead to confusion about whether people are double-voting, and such rumors can lead to outbreaks of violence.


13. No one will believe that the machine is not recording their identity. They will not believe it is a secret ballot. Even college students in the US respond far less to automated evaluation surveys than paper ones because they do not believe the automated systems disguise their identity. If you do not take an ID number, thumbprint, signature or other means of verifying identity, people will be able to report to your system multiple times, stuffing your ballot box, so to speak. 



14. In established democracies such as the United States, citizens might not be intimidated by being asked how they voted in exit polls, and the results of exit polls are often correct. Many experiments have been run about the conditions under which they report accurately how they voted. Have you done that research? It turns out that it matters whether you put a fake ballot box out front and ask them to drop in slips of paper or instead have them fill out a form, etc. Why are we to suppose your system will inspire people to report accurately?
