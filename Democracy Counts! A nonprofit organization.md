**Democracy Counts!**
A nonprofit organization *

**Our mission:** to ensure the integrity of democratic elections through the use of advanced auditing tools.

> Ballot box stuffing, vote stealing, vote switching and other electoral
> frauds are crimes against democracy. They rob citizens of their right
> to choose their government. Government loses its accountability to the
> governed, and the disfranchised suffer a slow brownout of their hopes
> and aspirations. Apathy increases and injustice flourishes.

Democracy requires free and fair elections. Free and fair elections require voting systems that are transparent and verifiable, to guarantee that the candidate winning the most votes is actually the candidate declared the winner. Most voting systems are vulnerable to fraud, however, and losing candidates are often declared the winner, with sometimes disastrous results for the polity of the country, and occasionally the world.
Democracy Counts! Is developing an election audit system called the VeriCount Electoral Accountability SystemTM. It empowers citizens to watchdog their elections to expose and prove fraud wherever it occurs. Our intention is to make it available to American watchdog organizations for the 2016 presidential election and afterwards to make it available globally, cheaply or free. 

The VeriCount system is built upon an open-source software engine that our team has also developed. This software engine is capable of powering a safe, reliable and unhackable voting system. Called the SolidVoteTM Electronic Voting System, it will be licensed to governments for use in their elections, and profits will be used to subsidize distribution of VeriCount. As SolidVoteâ€™s use increases, the need for VeriCount will decrease.

Use of the VeriCount system will deprive authoritarian regimes of the ability to rig elections with impunity. The result of that will be the slow but inexorable transformation of those political systems.

**How You Can Help**

We want to make this system available to the world as quickly as possible and with maximum impact. With your help we will be able to.
Please educate yourself on this website, then share our project in your network and encourage your friends to check us out. And please consider making a donation.
This is an opportunity to produce lasting positive change in democracies around the world. Please consider playing a role, however small, in making it happen.
